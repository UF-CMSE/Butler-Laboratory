          <p>The recent work by Nick Carmean, Troy Becker, and Michael Sims in the Sumerlin Group has shown that ultra-high molecular weight polymers can be prepared by photopolymerization of vinyl monomers in the presence of thiocarbonylthio compounds. The polymerizations occur in water, employ simple and inexpensive photoreactors, and yield well-defined homopolymers and block copolymers with ultra-high molecular weights (more than 8 million g/mol).</p>

              <p>McKenzie Coughlin and Elliot MacKrell, two undergraduate students in the <a href="http://sumerlin.chem.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">Sumerlin Research Group</a>, were named recipients of National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowships. This award was given to both students based on their demonstrated potential for significant achievements in science and engineering. Each fellowship provides a stipend and cost of education allowance that totals approximately $138,000 to support their graduate studies. Beginning this fall, McKenzie plans to attend the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, while Elliot will attend Caltech.</p>
